            <article>
                <p>I am a Chicago native, currently residing in Atlanta, GA. After working in the Chiropractic field for years, pursuing a doctorate degree in Chiropractic, and working in three different states; my perspective of my career changed. For those in the health industry, 2020 was our wake up call. I want to be apart of something that is rewarding, challenging, and evolving. I believe is have found that through web development.</p>
                <p>I am currently a candidate at Georgia Institute of Techniology. I have developed this portfolio to showcase my new found passion. I would like to thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio. Enjoy!</p>
